# APIthing


This code sets up a basic Express.js server to handle API requests related to user data. It imports the Express framework and user data from a JSON file, creates an Express application, and defines middleware for parsing JSON in requests as well as handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). The server uses an in-memory cache for optimized data retrieval and exposes an API endpoint at "/api/users" to fetch user data based on specified query parameters such as 'chID' (chapter ID) and 'id' (user ID). The API responses include relevant user or chapter data or error messages if the requested information is not found.
