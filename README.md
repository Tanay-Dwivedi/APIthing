# APIthing


This Node.js application uses the Express framework to create a server that provides access to user data stored in a JSON file. The server employs middleware to parse JSON in incoming requests and handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). The application incorporates an in-memory cache to optimize data retrieval. Two helper functions are defined to find a chapter by chapter ID and to find a user by ID across all chapters.
